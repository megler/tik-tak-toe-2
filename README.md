Answer to question:

When you have semantically stuctured HTML with proper naming and elements, it is helpful when you need to target specific elements either in your CSS or JS. For example, being able to target the ID of "gameboard" made it much easier to draw the game squares in the JS vs having the document.write() method last week. Document.write() limited what could be done to the squares because they were much harder to target. Given them a class/ID opened up many possibilities in both style and scripting.
